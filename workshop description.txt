Based on Danyadd's NextBot mod, but with major overhauls that significantly improve the ai. If it still isn't hard enough, try two!

Notes:
  - This mod is designed to work these mods:
    - Better Run (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2881047428)
    - Dynamic Debris Removal (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2677340659)
    - (if using debug mode) Better Console Clearer (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2881046775)
  - You can place mutliple nextbots by holding shift (or just by spawning it again)
  - Vehicles kinda make this boring (which I'll try to work on)



The code for this is split into 2 main files: nextbot.lua and entityAI.lua. EntityAI.lua holds the pathfinding and movement code, while nextbot.lua spawns the nextbot, handles options, and performs mod-specific abilities (such as jumping, exploding, and killing the player). If you want to make your own nextbot with special abilities, you should be able to do everything you want by only editing nextbot.lua.
